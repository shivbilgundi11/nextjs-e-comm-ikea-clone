Designed to give a good grip when you want to stir and pour at the same time.

The transparent jar makes it easy to find what you are looking for, regardless of where it is placed.

You can reduce your food waste by storing your dry foods in a jar with a tight-fitting lid, because it keeps the food fresh longer.

Suitable for storing dry foodstuffs.`,

Clean lines and supportive comfort, regardless if you’re reading, socialising with friends or just relaxing for a moment.

Each sofa has a unique expression since the wooden frame is first stained in a dark-brown tone and then covered with clear lacquer that makes the wood’s natural grains visible.

High-resilience foam in the seat and back makes the sofa regain its shape when you stand up, and it’s complemented with zigzag springs in the seat and supportive fabric in the back for a firm comfort.

You will sit stable and steady for years to come since the frame is made of hardwearing solid wood. You also enjoy a relaxed sitting position thanks to the angled backrest.

The tall legs in solid wood make it easy to vacuum or reach things hiding under the sofa to avoid clutter.

The elegant, fixed cover has a perfect fit that will last over time. You can choose from different covers and find one that suits you and your home.`,

      "A simple 18 cm high spring mattress. It´s firm with Bonnell springs, while a layer of foam on top and wadding in the quilted cover provide additional cushioning.",
    articleNum: "804.833.44",
    prodDetails: `MRP Rs.18,186 (incl. tax)

Bonnell springs provide stable and even support, giving you the feeling that you´re sleeping on top of the mattress rather than in it.

A layer of wadding and foam on the top adds a soft, cushioning feel to the firmness of the Bonnell springs.

The Bonnell springs help you maintain a comfortable body temperature while you sleep, since they have an open construction that allows air to circulate.

The soft fabric of the mattress is smooth to the touch.

The mattress is roll-packed so it’s easy to carry home and its practical handles on the sides help you when moving the mattress.

Choose a pillow you like to go with your mattress in order to really boost your sleep.

Bonnell springs are especially suitable for those who sleep alone, since the movements of the springs won’t disturb anyone else, for example if you have a habit of getting up for a midnight snack.

The springs run from edge to edge to avoid a gap if you want to place two mattresses next to each other.

The mattress cover is designed to stay firmly in place on the mattress.

Only to be used on one side – no need to turn the mattress over.

To keep the mattress fresh, use a textile cleaner suitable for upholstery and vacuum it occasionally.`,

The aroma-tight seal helps food retain its flavour and aroma longer.

Easy to clean thanks to glass, which also does not absorb odours or discolour from tomato sauce, etc. Transparent, so nothing is forgotten and left behind.

The jar can also be used as a serving bowl - or as a storage container, helping you keep things organised throughout the home.`,
